# 🧒 Missing Child Detection using Deep Learning
## 🧡 Humanitarian Mission

Every year, thousands of children go missing worldwide. The emotional toll on families is unimaginable, and timely identification is critical for safe recovery. This project leverages the power of **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** to support this mission by recognizing missing children through facial images.

By building an intelligent system that processes image data and assists in matching missing individuals with known records, we aim to contribute to a larger social good — helping families reunite with their loved ones.
